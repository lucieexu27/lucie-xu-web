### Running!

Running has become a big part of my life in Atlanta. I’ve connected with the local running community through the Atlanta Track Club as an ambassador, and have had a lot of fun at the various races through the year. I recently ran my first full marathon and got to explore the Silver Comet Trail while doing so! 


### Music

I play the piano and cello for fun and have been lucky to share music with others over the years — from touring with an orchestra in Portugal to performing at Carnegie Hall. In college, I also loved playing chamber music, including a memorable double-cello quintet. I also had the chance to soundcheck for Yoyo-Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble at a Gala!

I love taking photos of the places I have been able to visit. Some of my favorite destinations are pictured above: Paris, Iceland, and Hawaii.
