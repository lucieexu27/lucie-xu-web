I am a college ambassador for the Atlanta Track Club. It has been a great experience to represent the club at my university. Being an ambassador has not only allowed me to connect to Emory's community, but also other runners from all over Atlanta. I have run a few half marathons in Atlanta, but would love to explore other areas for races.

I play the piano and the cello. I have toured with an orchestra in Portugal and played at Carnegie Hall in the past. I have also played in a few chamber music groups in college, including a double cello quintet!

I love taking photos of the places I have been able to visit. Some of my favorite destinations are pictured above: Paris, Iceland, and Hawaii.
